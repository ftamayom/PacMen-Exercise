# PacMen Exercise
This is an example of handling arrays. Add a PacMans list that will move randomly and at different speeds in the DOM. You will see that they bounce when they reach the edge.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ftamayom/PacMenExercise.git
```

2. Go to ```PacMenExercise``` folder and open ```index.html``` file in your browser.

## Usage
When you open it in the browser, two buttons appear. First click **Add PacMac**, as many times as you like for PacMans to appear. Then click **Start Game**, so the PacMans start moving and bouncing everywhere.

## Future Improvements
I had no problem developing this code. Some improvements that I will make later will be:
* Besides pacman I will add other videogame characters.
* Each character will have unique animation while moving, I think it will look fun.
* Change white background to space with stars.
